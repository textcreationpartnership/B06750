            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis Bearer promiſing me to ſee you before he left <hi>Dublin,</hi> gave me the occaſion of troubling you with this Letter, requeſting that you will be mindful of my ſmall buſineſs, amidſt the many more of greater concern; for my ſole dependence is upon your care in the management of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But before I leave you, <hi>I</hi> muſt acquaint you with a moſt Horrid and Barbarous Murder committed by one <hi>William Sherloge</hi> (and a certain Woman that was a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his, who was both his Wench, and his Accomplice) on the Body of his own Wife and Child, on <hi>Sunday</hi> night laſt the <hi>8th</hi> of this Month: And thus it was; This Villain <hi>Sherloge</hi> (as was found upon examination) had kept company with this Woman, who lived near his own Houſe; and becauſe they could not have the freedom of each others unlawful Embraces, they both conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Diſpatch his Wife, and accordingly he went out after night fell, and return'd with his <hi>Jezabel</hi> in the dead time of the night, and entred the Houſe, where they found his Wife and Child a-ſleep, and arming himſelf with a Hatchet and Sword, he went to the Bed-ſide, and took his Wife by the Hair, and knockt her Brains out, and afterwards ſtabb'd her in ſeveral places: the Child ſeeing her Mother ſo ſtrangely Butcher'd, lamentably wept, and begged her Father not not to kill her Mother, and ſhe wou'd kiſs him; yet nothing prevail'd with him. In the mean time this Jilt was not Idle, but imploy'd her ſelf in murdering the Servant-Maid, which ſhe ſuppoſed ſhe had done, by knocking her on the Head with a Mallet, and then dragg'd her out of the Houſe, but (by providence) the Maid reviv'd, and made ſhift to creep to a Neighbour's Houſe, which was about a Muſquet-ſhot from the place. But in the
<pb facs="tcp:174246:2"/>mean while, (which is the moſt dreadful part of this Narrative) the curſed Whore told him that the Child muſt be kill'd, or elſe ſhe would Hang them both; he told her that he could not kill his own Child, but bid her do it; which ſhe immediately did in a moſt cruel manner, and laid the innocent Babe (which was about ſix years of age) by her murdered Mother; and having got ſome dry Wood, they plac'd it about the mangled bodies, and then ſert the Houſe on fire. The day approaching, the Woman-murderer went out, and not finding the Maid, ſhe went home, and <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge</hi> appear'd early in the morning, almoſt naked, crying out, that Rogues had murder'd his Family, and ſett his Houſe on fire, and that he had eſcaped out at a Window; but the Maid's diſcovery caus'd both him and his Whore to be apprehended, and carried before Capt. <hi>Evans,</hi> who committed them to <hi>Cork</hi> Goal. Great care is taken to recover the Maid, and it is ſuppoſed ſhe will do well. My curioſity led me to the place, where I ſaw the remains of thoſe murdered bodies; the Child's heart, and ſome part of her body remain untouch'd, and that part of the Mother's body and head that received the ſtrokes. If I ſhould deſcend to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it would exceed the bounds of a Letter; and therefore I have only ſent you what I heard deliver'd by the Girl afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and am,</p>
